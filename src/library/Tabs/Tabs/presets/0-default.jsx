        Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral, with the formula
        Cu2CO3(OH)2. This opaque, green banded mineral crystallizes in the
        monoclinic crystal system, and most often forms botryoidal, fibrous, or
        stalagmitic masses, in fractures and spaces, deep underground, where the
        water table and hydrothermal fluids provide the means for chemical
        precipitation.

        Fluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium
        fluoride, CaF2. It belongs to the halide minerals. It crystallizes in
        isometric cubic habit, although octahedral and more complex isometric
        forms are not uncommon. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on
        scratch hardness comparison, defines value 4 as Fluorite. Fluorite is a
        colorful mineral, both in visible and ultraviolet light, and the stone
        has ornamental and lapidary uses. Industrially, fluorite is used as a
        flux for smelting, and in the production of certain glasses and enamels.
        The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric
        acid manufacture, which is the intermediate source of most
        fluorine-containing fine chemicals.

        Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the
        chemical formula Fe3O4. It is one of the oxides of iron, and is
        ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to
        become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the
        naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of
        magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is
        how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Today it
        is mined as iron ore. Small grains of magnetite occur in almost all
        igneous and metamorphic rocks.
